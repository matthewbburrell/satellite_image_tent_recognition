#  Finding Tents and Other Emergency Housing Through Exploitation of Satellite Imagery

*Problem Statement:* During disasters, emergency management agencies and humanitarian organizations need to know where survivors are congregating in order to provide emergency supplies and services. Sometimes, as was the case during the January 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico, local communities set up tents as informal shelters. State and national-level organizations may not know about these shelters for days. How can satellite imagery be used to identify informal shelters? Can the same imagery be used to observe changes in the number of tents or occupants? Can we see when a tent shelter is taken down?
